## Synopsis

This is a read-only repository mirror for dblg.
There's nothing to say here yet---stay tuned!
But in short, the project consists of a backend server (in C, requiring
[kcgi](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi) and
[ksql](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/ksql)) that serves JSON to two
front-ends.
The first is for writing blogs.
The second is for viewing them.
The writing tool would probably be installed as-is, but I'd expect the
latter to be integrated into one or more other pages.

## Installation

Nothing here yet!
